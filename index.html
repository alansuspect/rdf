    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Raging Death Films is small low-budget film production company based in the Isle of Man.</p>
    <p>Starting out in 2009 we begin by making the short film "Get Dead" for the 2 Days Later short horror film competition, which inspired us to continue writing and explore the possibilties of making short films on a miniscule budget.</p>
    <p>In 2010 we entered the competition again with the short ‘In Mourning’. Both of these films have helped us develop has film makers.</p>
    <p>Since then we have been on hiatus. Hopefully one day we will turn.</p>
    <p>Until then you can enjoy our films on this website.</p>
