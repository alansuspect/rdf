    <p><em>*Warning, this video contains a ridiculous amount of swearing, mainly due to everyone forgetting their lines*</em></p>
    <p>Get Dead was the first proper short film we made at Raging Death Films and it was entered into the <a href="http://2dayslater.co.uk/" target="_blank">2 Days Later Film Competition</a> in 2009. It was a lot of fun making the film as, per the brief’s guidelines, all writing, shooting and editing had to be completed in no more than 48 hours total.</p>
    <p>In order to get the film off the ground we used various social networks including Facebook and MySpace to recruit willing volunteers to dress up as zombies. Due to the logistics we shot most of the zombie footage in one day, in one location, then shot to our other main location for the rest of the film. Although the actors had very little time to prepare for their roles they performed well, despite a torrent of swearing between each forgotten line.</p>
    <p>We didn't win the competition, but (and considering there were over 230 films entered that year) we did make it to the main hall in a matinee screening sometime around 4pm, so we were pretty chuffed with that.</p>

    <p>This was our second entry to the <a href="http://www.2dayslater.co.uk/" target="_blank">2 Days Later Film Competition</a>, this time in 2010.</p>
    <p>We were quite rushed with this entry as we left it quite near to the deadline before filming (although we still only had the same amount of time given the nature of the competition), but we had an idea for the story which we hope come across in the final film.</p>
    <p>The story revolved around a man returning from a funeral, only to find his best friend who he’d just buried has come back to torture him.</p>
