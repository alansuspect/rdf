<p>Below is a very rough archive of our old blog, taken from Tumblr. It may be broken in places and some of the images or videos may not work (or be referenced to but not actually appear), but it's still fairly readable.

    <h2>Scriptwriting for Mannin Shorts<br />
    <font size=2> [ Posted <a href="http://ragingdeathfilms.im/post/12883898329"> Tue, 08 Feb 2011 10:38:00</a> ]</font>

    <p>Hey film fans! Tonight we&#8217;re attending the <a href="http://manninshorts.com">Mannin Shorts</a> Writer&#8217;s Room to discuss the scripts we&#8217;ve entered into their scheme, and talk about some of the finer points of script writing. This is followed on Saturday by the Filmmaker&#8217;s Workshop where we&#8217;ll learn more about the film making process, and finally we get a one-to-one session to help us refine our scripts ready for submission to the judges.<br/><br/>I can&#8217;t tell you much about the script for a short film I&#8217;ve submitted but it&#8217;s pretty good and a bit different to our other stories. If it wins, it will be great to have the opportunity to make a proper short film with a budget and everything.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ll let you know how we get on!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-4113120554759760388?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<h2>New camera and playing around<br />

<p><p>I&#8217;m not sure what it is about zombies but they&#8217;re very accessible.<br/><br/>I bought a new camera (replacing the Canon XM2) this month; a Canon 550D DLSR so it doubles up as a stills camera too (check out some photos taken with it on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/alansuspect">Flickr</a>). To get stuck in shooting some video with it we decided to do some test shots which weren&#8217;t really connected narratively but would look like they were from the same film. Naturally, we chose a zombie outbreak as the background to our &#8220;film&#8221;.<br/><br/>Since it was at late notice we didn&#8217;t get a great amount of zombies but we did get some conventional footage that looks great and we can definitely use. Hopefully we&#8217;ll be shooting some more zombie action this weekend, and maybe there&#8217;ll be some way we can stick it all together for everyone to watch. Who knows!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-2030367253754569190?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p>Just a quick post to say we have, bar one or two short external shots, wrapped! It&#8217;s been good fun working on a film again and even better having a bit more of a crew to get everything done (Simon Talbot working the sound was a blessing). I started editing last week after the first two nights shooting so for the next few nights I&#8217;ll be getting it polished, on top of which we also need to score the film and have it sent away by the start of next week. Busy times!<br/><br/>Maybe one day we&#8217;ll make a film to a sensible schedule with no time constraints. I doubt it though.<br/><br/>In other great news <a href="http://www.manninshorts.com">Mannin Shorts</a> had their filmmakers&#8217; extravaganza the other week where a video interview consisting of us and other Manx filmmakers was shown. You can see the video below.<br/><br/>Hopefully the next blog post will say &#8220;We&#8217;ve Finished!&#8221; as there&#8217;ll be little time for anything else, so see you then.<br/><br/><object width="590" height="332"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=15125777&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=dd3333&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0"><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=15125777&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=dd3333&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="590" height="332"></embed></object><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-3369385261825370936?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

We were lent a dolly and track kit by Glenn at <a href="http://www.yourmoviecrew.com/"><a href="http://www.yourmoviecrew.com">http://www.yourmoviecrew.com</a></a> (which is a lot of fun, by the way, and we&#8217;ve had to restrain ourselves from over-using it) and a lighting kit from Christy and Dave at <a href="http://www.anotherdam.com/"><a href="http://www.anotherdam.com">http://www.anotherdam.com</a></a>.

This is Nic&#8217;s first role and he&#8217;s getting into it with gusto.<br/><br/><a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luriuiTaBo1qakin8.jpg" id="image"><img class="right" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luriuiTaBo1qakin8.jpg" width="150"/></a>We&#8217;ve got some great shots down so far and it&#8217;s looking like the film will come together quite nicely - although that&#8217;s always the deathly blow to something going well. We&#8217;re back on set tonight, we&#8217;re optimistic we&#8217;ll get the rest shot tonight but we have next week to film any extra stuff or do any re-shoots if necessary.<br/><br/>Fun!</p>

<p><p>A couple of little things of note here. First up, this evening we commence shooting our film. And you are correct, there is still no title for it. Our working title is too ridiculous to mention in public but we have come up with a concept idea for the title (don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not as pompous and trite as it sounds) which potentially could make this film the first in a series of shorts. But that is a discussion for another time. Right now we&#8217;re really concerning ourselves with getting this film, you know, <em>made</em>.<br/><br/>Lists have been made, equipment gathered and talent poached and now we begin the fun bit. Well, the first fun bit. Tonight and tomorrow are the set shoot evenings with next week also available for any re-shoots or missed scenes. It&#8217;s a very small cast and crew this time round so everyone will be pitching in to get it finished, but we&#8217;ll try and get some on-set photos so you can see what we&#8217;re going for.<br/><br/>That just about covers everything, I&#8217;ll blog later in the week with how we got on and what is (inevitably) left to do.<br/><br/>Here we go!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-2826924991445021361?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<h2>New film, gear and interview<br />

<p><p>Last week we did an interview with Christy and Dave at DAM Productions for their latest venture <a href="http://manninshorts.wordpress.com/" title="MannIN Shorts">MannIN Shorts</a> (also follow them on <a href="http://twitter.com/manninshorts" title="MannIN Shorts Twitter">Twitter</a>) which, to quote their bio is &#8220;a platform for hopeful filmmakers, young or old, to develop skills, ideas and make films, right here on the Isle of Man&#8221;. It sounds great and I hope loads of cool things come about because of it.<br/><br/>Needless to say we&#8217;re so brilliant at RDF they just <em>had </em>to get an interview with us, so we obliged. It will be shown along with a bunch of interviews with other brilliant local filmy bods at their Grand Isle of Man Film Makers Show-Down on 9th September. Check out their website for more info on that.<br/><br/>As for our own project, well we&#8217;re gearing up to get the next film off the ground. With only a month to go before the deadline for submissions for this year&#8217;s 2 Days Later competition we&#8217;re cutting it finer than last year (I think I was editing by this point - cripes) but we are working on a much smaller scale so hopefully that will work in our favour.<br/><br/><a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lusulttUfj1qakin8.jpg" id="image"><img class="left" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lusulttUfj1qakin8.jpg" width="150"/></a>We, pretty much, have all our gear sorted for the shoot, you can see a couple of photos to the left and right. That&#8217;s my MacBook. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;m writing this post on and what I edited Get Dead on too. This will be used (along with Final Cut Pro 5, Cubase 4 and various other tools) to put the final film together.<br/><br/><a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lusun0UuHp1qakin8.jpg" id="image"><img class="left" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lusun0UuHp1qakin8.jpg" width="150"/></a>This is our camera. It&#8217;s a Canon XM2 on a swanky Manfrotto tripod. Since we spent all our money on these items there was nothing left to buy anything in the way of lenses, so we&#8217;re making do with what we can get for a reasonable sum. Initially we just tried one of those ridiculously cheap and obviously rubbish wide angle lenses you can get off eBay for buttons but their limitations soon became apparent. Visually not bad, my main issue with them was the terrible vignetting that occurred. That and the fact there was a macro lens you had to always have attached, which just didn&#8217;t sit right with me.<br/><br/>Now, as can possibly be seen in the photo, we have a bigger and better wide angle lens (this is the extent we&#8217;re going to with lenses for now, they&#8217;re a whole other money-sapping beast entirely) and since we couldn&#8217;t afford the Canon-branded one (WD-58H) we picked up a decent one from Digital King for about £60ish. It&#8217;s a 0.7x wide angle for those who are interested. Not enough to really cause obvious vertical line distortion (shame though as I&#8217;m a massive Terry Gilliam fan) but enough that we can get a decent amount of stuff in shot and not rely on lots of panning or tracking.<br/><br/>Aside from these main things we also have a nice light reflector to go with the lights we&#8217;re hoping to borrow for the shoot, some condenser mics from a drum mic kit we&#8217;re using for overheads and some other miscellaneous bits and pieces we&#8217;ve managed to lay our grubby mits on.<br/><br/>I hope this has interested you! We&#8217;re looking at meeting up next week to discuss the shoot then will immediately begin shooting. Hurrah!</p>

<p><p>Work is progressing well with the new film (of which we have yet to come up with a good title, we&#8217;re working on that) and we now have a script ready for production.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of other things we need to sort out before we can start filming though; some of the less wordy scenes have been storyboarded and we&#8217;ll make some photo storyboards for more general scenes - we don&#8217;t really have the time to produce full storyboards so a lot of it will be made up on the day. Some of the best ideas come from improvisation!<br/><br/>We also need to get our gear in order. After last year&#8217;s competition we went all out and bought a load of cool equipment, initially to make the film &#8216;Hello, My Name Is Rick&#8217; (which has now been put on hold whilst we make this year&#8217;s 2 Days Later entry), and now will be used to make this film. I&#8217;ll be posting up a blog entry showing you all our gear in a bit, plus what we&#8217;ll be editing on and scoring with. Although we&#8217;re pushed for time I&#8217;m hoping to get some time to get a nice score down, as Get Dead missed out on that stage of things.<br/><br/>We&#8217;re away for the next week or so (on and off) so we&#8217;ll post up after that, and hopefully have some news of the filming schedule too.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-8813031625314622216?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p><p>We have news!  It comes in two flavours I&#8217;m afraid; we&#8217;ve got some good news and some bad news regarding our entry for the 2 Days Later Film Competition.<br/><br/>The bad news is that unfortunately we won&#8217;t be making our planned sequel to 2009&#8217;s Get Dead. I know, it&#8217;s very sad and we&#8217;re aware a lot of you wanted to get involved with it. The reason we aren&#8217;t making it for the competition is because our ideas are too grandiose and outlandish to be shot and completed within the time constraints and with a maximum film length imposed. We felt we would do the film a disservice if we tried to cram everything we wanted to do in and didn&#8217;t want to pressure everyone with the lack of time available.<br/><br/>For all those folks who were looking forward to getting mucked up and zombified - don&#8217;t worry, we have every intention of making this film and hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to next year depending on everyone&#8217;s availability, etc. We came up with a lot of ideas before postponing it and we don&#8217;t want them going to waste. In fact it makes me giddy just thinking about some of the things we came up with.<br/><br/>Okay, onto the good news. As we&#8217;re all a bit pushed for time this year anyway (what with our other hobbies like being in bands and having to work full-time jobs, etc) we&#8217;re scaling right back for this year&#8217;s film. Obviously I don&#8217;t want to go into too much detail yet and ruin the story but in the spirit of keeping it vague for now we&#8217;re taking the psychological/suspense path (if that&#8217;s a path) and have a cracking good idea we think will really work. If I say much more I&#8217;ll end up telling you everything, so I won&#8217;t, but we&#8217;re going for a very different feel with this film and it should be an interesting and creepy story to boot.<br/><br/>I hope you aren&#8217;t all too disappointed in our decision, it was a very hard one to make and we&#8217;re really hoping to get the sequel to Get Dead made in the near future with better production values and more time and care taken to make it.<br/><br/>We will be blogging here about our filming as and when we commence production with some behind the scenes stuff, the equipment we&#8217;ll be using and more info on the story as it develops (not too much though heh).<br/><br/>Stay a while, stay forever!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-4445913646617419966?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p>Friends! It&#8217;s been a while but we&#8217;re breaking our silence to say that we&#8217;re coming back to where it all began. We&#8217;re going to enter this year&#8217;s 2 Days Later film competition.<br/><br/>We&#8217;re keeping quiet about it at the moment (unless you ask us after a few pints of guest ales down the Rovers or something) but I&#8217;m hoping to keep the blog going like last year with updates on what we&#8217;re doing with some behind-the-scenes video clips, photos and other cool stuff.<br/><br/>Once we start scripting (and the clock is ticking) we&#8217;ll tell you more about the project we&#8217;re working on. I&#8217;ll give you a tasty bit of info though - there&#8217;s going to be zombies. LOTS of zombies. We&#8217;re going to need a big group of folks to help out this year so if you&#8217;re interested in getting involved let us know and tell your friends. We&#8217;ll be setting up a Facebook group and all that nearer the time, once we have a date, etc.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s going to be fun!<br/><br/>Edit - forgot to add, Get Dead got featured in the 2010 trailer for the competition!

<p><p>It&#8217;s only taken several months but now everything has calmed down we&#8217;re having our film premiere for all the cast and crew who helped make the film what it is. Whatever that might be.<br/><br/>So tomorrow night the whole bunch will descend on Douglas to watch the 10 minute epic, as well as end credits and extras which wouldn&#8217;t fit into the competition edit.

<h2>2 Days Later Press Release<br />

<p><p>Well as was fairly expected we didn&#8217;t win anything, but well done to those who did. It sounds like there were a lot of good films shown, hopefully they&#8217;ll put some up on their website for us all to see. Here is their press release from the showing (by the way, I know I totally got the day wrong on the last entry):<br/><br/><strong>2 DAYS LATER 2009 SHORT FILM COMPETITION</strong><br/><br/><strong>HALLOWEEN SCREENING &amp; AWARDS @ THE THEATRE ROYAL MARGATE, 31st OCTOBER 2009</strong><br/><br/>The Scots Steal the Show at Kent's Biggest Short Film Festival!<br/><br/>Over 300 Filmmakers and audiences came from all over the UK and abroad to watch 59 films at the '2 Days Later 09 Competition Halloween Screening &amp; Awards Event' at The Theatre Royal, Margate. The second oldest Georgian theatre in the country is home to a ghost or two of its own and the venue provided a magnificent backdrop to Kent's biggest and scariest film screening event.<br/><br/><em>"The filmmakers really got into the 'spirit' of the event and experienced a very diverse and innovative programme this year. We had everything from modern day humanoid aliens taking over Sheffield, to a classic 1950's B-movie werewolf homage, which had them all cowering in the aisles with fright and laughter!"</em><br/><br/>Mick Etherton, 2 Days Later Co-director<br/><br/>Since July 2009, entrants from across the Europe have been downloading the competition brief from the 2 Days Later website and then taking up the challenge to make a their mini-horror masterpieces in under 48hrs that had to feature three items from a given list as part of their film productions.<br/><br/>From over 900 Internet downloads and 59 film entries to competition, the judging panel eventually decided that David Keith's film, DEAD FUNNY, was dead good! A chilling tale of a group of campers, stalked by a clown. The Aberdeen-based director scooped BEST SOUND, BEST, EDITOR BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY, BEST DIRECTOR, &amp; BEST SHORT FILM! Returning home with a car boot full of Horror DVDs and a week's hire of a professional HD Camera Filming Kit from London sponsor's VMI High Definition &amp; Broadcast, worth £3000!<br/><br/><em>"There was a fantastic atmosphere here on tonight and it was great to see so many previous filmmakers return with their new films. 22 of the 59 films were made in Kent and we also had films made for the competition, from Wales, Scotland, and even Switzerland; and they all actually came over to Thanet for the screenings! The imaginatively diverse film styles made it very difficult for the judges to agree on clear winners as the standard was even higher than last year."</em><br/><br/>Mick Etherton, 2 Days Later Co-director<br/><br/>The 300-strong audience had other ideas for their favourite film of the evening, as their AUDIENCE BEST POPULAR SHORTLISTED FILM vote went to the cannibalistic comedy, MEAT, by Basingstoke based director, Alex Loeseke. MEAT's culinary lead role, played by James Burton, also won the Judges' Award for BEST ACTOR.<br/><br/>From Kent; the BEST SFX Award went to Hythe based director Philip Mearns, for 1950's B- movie homage-'VENGENCE OF THE CREATURE FROM BEYOND'..<br/><br/>While previous competition prizewinners Ben Worsfield &amp; William Thomas from Chatham, was nominated in five categories. Canterbury based filmmaker Bruce Parleton's internet dating film LOL, was nominated for BEST FILM, BEST SCREENPLAY  and BEST ACTOR.<br/><br/>A SPECIAL MENTION Award went to Canterbury filmmakers Rosie Escott &amp; Philip Benedict for the successful innovation in his stereoscopic 3 D horror 'SHORTCUT' using only a pair of twin mounted low-fi digital stills cameras!<br/><br/>BEST STUDENT FILM was won by Canterbury Christ Church University student,  Przemek Konieczny for his dreamy experimental horror 'MOTH'.<br/><br/>Victoria Bailey won BEST ACTRESS for her starring role in the urban horror 'RIAD'. shot in Sheffield city centre.<br/><br/>Swiss Director Sebastien Cornioley and his filmmaking team's weekend dash across France was very worthwhile, collecting the audience vote for the BEST POPULAR MATINEE FILM, beating the other 46 matinee screenings.<br/><br/>The awards were presented by film industry judges; Wendy Ide (The Times film critic), Damon Wise (The Guardian film critic) and Screen South's Co-Head of Production, Development and Training David Castro.<br/><br/>Murderous Marguerites were drunk by all and the fright night ended at 3.00am with an  after-party at The Westcoast Bar, Mansion Street, Margate.<br/><br/>This free filmmaking Event is organised by Beeping Bush, with the aid of UK Film Council's regional film agency, Screen South funding, and prize sponsorship by VMI High Definition and Broadcast.<br/><br/>THE JUDGING PANEL<br/><br/>Kim Newman, Film Critic &amp; Horror Author<br/><br/>Wendy Ide, Film Critic The Guardian / The Observer<br/><br/>Damon Wise, Film Critic The Times / Sunday Times / Empire Magazine<br/><br/>David Castro, Screen South Co-Head of Production, Development and Training<br/><br/>Mike Shaw, A Writer and journalist, who has contributed to various magazines &amp; newspapers including NME, The Sun, The Independent, and The Telegraph.Film correspondent KM What's On, Founder/editor-in chief of The Void, entertainments' website<br/><br/>Barry Basset, Managing Director - VMI High Definition and Broadcast<br/><br/>Steve   Taylor, Operations Manager - VMI High Definition and Broadcast<br/><br/>2Dl09 FILM NOMINATIONS &amp; WINNERS in BOLD<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST ACTOR</span><br/><strong>Meat  - James Burton</strong><br/>Dead-Funny - Gavin Park<br/>LOL  - Dave Reed<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST ACTRESS</span><br/><strong>Raid â€“ Victoria Bailey</strong><br/>The Lincolnshire Poacher â€“ Rachel Button<br/>Sarah â€“ Nova Woodrow<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST SFX</span><br/><strong>Vengence of the Creature from Beyond</strong><br/>Download<br/>Dead-Funny<br/>The Lincolnshire Poacher<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST SOUND</span><br/><strong>Dead-Funny</strong><br/>Download<br/>The Lincolnshire Poacher<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST EDITOR</span><br/><strong>Dead-Funny</strong><br/>The Lincolnshire Poacher<br/>Vengence of the Creature from Beyond<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY</span><br/><strong>Dead-Funny</strong><br/>The Lincolnshire Poacher<br/>Raid<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST SCREENPLAY</span><br/><strong>Meat</strong><br/>LOL<br/>Dead-Funny<br/>Sarah<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST DIRECTOR</span><br/><strong>Dead-Funny</strong><br/>Raid<br/>Meat<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIAL MENTION AWARD</span><br/><strong>Cock Prosthetics â€“ William Fitzgerald</strong><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIAL MENTION AWARD</span><br/><strong>Steroscopic 3D - Shortcut</strong><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/>BEST GORE AWARD</span><br/><strong>Open Season</strong><br/>Cock<br/>Dead â€“Funny<br/>Dia Del Motor<br/>Perfect Man<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST STUDENT</span><br/><strong>Moth</strong><br/>Dead Late<br/>MOV1<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AUDIENCE BEST POPULAR VOTE MATINEE SCREENING</span><br/><strong>Holiday Bloodyday</strong><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AUDIENCE BEST POPULAR VOTE SHORTLIST SCREENING</span><br/><strong>Meat</strong><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEST SHORT FILM</span><br/><strong>Dead-Funny</strong><br/>Meat<br/>LOL<br/><br/>With over 900 requests for the competition brief,<br/><br/>59 film entries were accepted in time for screening.

<p><p>Well folks, by now our film will have probably been shown. I wonder how we did?

<p><p>Raging Deathers!<br/><br/>We have had word back from the 2 Days Later chaps, they now have our film and have announced the times of all the films. As a bonus they even mentioned the IOM in their e-mail to all entrants:<br/></p><blockquote><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We received over 800 requests for  this year&#8217;s 2DL09 competition brief, so word is rapidly spreading about the  event. We have received films from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, &amp; Isle  of Man; two films from Switzerland and one in 3D!!!</span></blockquote><br/>(yeah, there is apparently one in 3D)<br/><br/>At the moment we don&#8217;t quite know how the judging is going to work, if the shortlist of 13 films given an evening viewing are the category winners then there&#8217;s a good chance we won&#8217;t be winning anything, but since this hasn&#8217;t been confirmed we&#8217;re staying confindent.<br/><br/>There is some pretty good news though; they had 58 films entered this year (the most ever, apparently) and since there are so many it has been a sqeeze getting them all in. They have a number (three) of monitors in the theatre where the premiere is shown, which are dotted around the complex, as well as the main showings in the cinema screens - we have managed to score a 4pm showing slot as part of the Matinee Screening which is great news!<br/><br/>Unfortunately it&#8217;s looking like we&#8217;re not going to be able to make it to the showing due to cost and time restrains, but if anyone happens to be in or near Margate (however unlikely) you could do worse than popping into the Theatre Royal on the afternoon of Saturday 31st October to see Get Dead on a proper cinema screen.<br/><br/>We are still working on a local showing of the film, which if all goes to plan will actually be a longer version of the one being shown for the competition (we had to cut it down by several minutes to fit into the entry specifications). Our plan was to try for something over Halloween (well, Hop-tu-naa) but we&#8217;re getting close to that date now and people are already making plans for the weekend - a rare sighting of Swound! in particular. Our original screening plan was pretty cool and hopefully we can still pull it off, but if not don&#8217;t fear, you will definitely get to see it in some shape or form.<br/><br/>Also try and grab a copy of the October issue of Banter if you can to read an article all about us and our making of this film.<br/><br/>Let&#8217;s leave it there for now and hope we hear some good news from the competition and for the local screening soon!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-1245341182644950889?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p><p>Well folks we started on this adventure around mid-July and after hours of planning and filming and editing we have finished the film! Here is the proof, all packaged up and ready to be sent to the competition people: <a href="http://twitpic.com/iuh49"><a href="http://twitpic.com/iuh49">http://twitpic.com/iuh49</a></a>.<br/><br/>Get Dead has been officially completed.<br/><br/>Of course they may still decide that, for some unfortunate reason, we shouldn&#8217;t be accepted into the competition. That would be a shame but we shouldn&#8217;t dwell on it. After all, we&#8217;ve had loads of fun making this film and it has turned out a lot better than expected, and in the process it has taken on a life of it&#8217;s own rather than just an entry for a competition.<br/><br/>We&#8217;re going to take a short break now. When we return we will post up a trailer for film and various other bits of promotional wizardry and hopefully have some news on a local premiere, which has yet to be finalised and confirmed yet. Stay tuned.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-2285494194062492687?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p><p>Yes indeedy, this weekend marked a major milestone in the post-apocalyptic world of Get Dead - we&#8217;ve finished &#8216;Principle Photography&#8217; and are now into post-production! Meaning we&#8217;ve filmed all we are going to film and we can crack on with making it look smart now.<br/><br/>We really want to thank everyone that has got the film to this point so far, we couldn&#8217;t have done it without all the help we&#8217;ve had. Although it&#8217;s only a short 10-minute film, we have all put a lot of effort into making sure it doesn&#8217;t turn out crap and most importantly we&#8217;ve had fun doing it too. So thanks.<br/><br/>If you haven&#8217;t already, go and have a look at the the short behind-the-scenes video in the <a href="/videos/">Videos</a> section and some more photos in the <a href="/photo-gallery">Photo Gallery</a>.<br/><br/>Upcoming news - we are now working on editing and finishing the film so we&#8217;ll keep our heads low for the next week or so with the aim of getting the film in for the competition deadline of 30th September. After that we&#8217;ll work on getting an official trailer up to keep you all enticed ;). With the competition premiere (for winners, obviously, which we won&#8217;t count ourselves being just yet) held at the end of October we haven&#8217;t made any plans yet for a local showing, but we are keen to work something out so we&#8217;ll let you know as soon as we have something definite planned.<br/><br/>That&#8217;s all for now though.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-5073352347928947865?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p><p>On Thursday 3rd September the Manx Radio programme Perspective went out with a look at the zombie horror genre with Jason Roberts. He took a look at a bunch of films and talked with both film lecturers at the college and with us on-set in Sulby during our &#8216;zombie day out&#8217;.

<p><p>Well wouldn&#8217;t you know it. Very shortly after I sent that blog post I got a message from our lead man John (that&#8217;s him up the top there) saying he has broken his big toe so unfortunately we&#8217;re having to put back tomorrow&#8217;s shoot until, probably, next weekend.<br/><br/>Bit of a blow but I suppose these things can&#8217;t be helped.

<p><p>We are approaching the halfway point of our alotted 48 hours for shooting this film and so far we&#8217;re doing quite well. It&#8217;s fairly tricky managing our time (especially with jobs, etc getting in the way) but everyone involved with the film so far has totally enjoyed themselves and have been willing to put everything they&#8217;ve got into helping it become a success.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s also tricky talking about the film without giving too much away. Obviously everyone knows we&#8217;re making a zombie film but other than that we don&#8217;t want to tell the whole story without ruining the viewing experience, and since it will have a maximum length of 10 minutes we aren&#8217;t going to be delving into too much character back-story or anything like that, so action and cutting dialogue take precedence.<br/><br/>We have an estimated 3 or 4 more days filming, depending on various things like weather, actor availabilty and location availability but we&#8217;re fairly confident we can stick to this, then begins the mammoth task of editing the film and making it look so good the judges will have no option but to award us the winning prize!<br/><br/>Right now we&#8217;re looking at a crazy-hour, early morning shoot tomorrow although I won&#8217;t say where as we don&#8217;t want random people showing up, we need it as barren and desolate as possible. It&#8217;s going to be quite tough as none of us are great at getting up early, but hopefully if we can pull it off it will really work well in the final edit.<br/><br/>Finally I&#8217;d like to just say another thanks to all the guys and girls who came down last weekend to spend an afternoon standing in a field, it was a fun day and thanks to you we have probably one of the best scenes in the film!<br/><br/>(Do a Columbo, do a Columbo&#8230;) Oh just one more thing, Jason Roberts from Manx Radio was down last weekend and did an interview with some of the cast and crew. My interview went out on Mandate PM on Monday (listen again: <a href="http://manxradio.com/audiovault/PMMON.wma"><a href="http://manxradio.com/audiovault/PMMON.wma">http://manxradio.com/audiovault/PMMON.wma</a></a>, you may need to open it in <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> or Windows Media Player), but the full thing will be on the Perspective programme at 6pm on Thursday 3rd September, here&#8217;s the link to the show: <a href="http://manxradio.com/blog.aspx?blogid=14704"><a href="http://manxradio.com/blog.aspx?blogid=14704">http://manxradio.com/blog.aspx?blogid=14704</a></a>.<br/><br/>And that is everything for now.

Look forward to seeing you all tomorrow, and thanks to the people who can offer lifts to others, it&#8217;s much appreciated.<br/><br/>And as a final bonus, Chris Flood Band, Suspect Package and Divide by Zero are playing the Traf for Flood&#8217;s birthday, head on down!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-256299289284161663?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p><p>It&#8217;s a bit of a bummer that there&#8217;s a few things on this weekend but unfortunately we&#8217;re really pushed for time in making the film to get it in by the submissions deadline so unless the weather is terrible we&#8217;ll be going ahead this weekend regardless.<br/><br/>That said, it&#8217;s going to be a great day and we&#8217;re hoping as many people as possible turn up. If you&#8217;re a definite &#8220;yes&#8221; then please let us know as it will give us a better indication of roughly how many people are going to show.<br/><br/>We will be on site from around 11am, we&#8217;re looking for people to show up at 12pm but please feel free to come earlier if you can. Due to it also being the first day of the Manx Grand Prix we&#8217;re looking to finish up by 5pm at the latest, this should give us a good few hours filming, although we really don&#8217;t know how long it will take.<br/><br/>On site we will have make up and water for cleaning up afterwards, although we&#8217;d recommend bringing an old towel or something if you have one as we probably won&#8217;t have any spares. We&#8217;d also like to stress again to please wear old clothes as they will get covered in fake blood (which stains) and if you don&#8217;t mind ripping them a little then all the better.<br/><br/>The more zombies turn up the better so please tell your friends, and if you&#8217;re able to drive out please hook up with anyone who can&#8217;t get a lift so we can get everyone out there.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ll post directions up if people need them, the field we&#8217;re using is in Sulby valley. Heading from Douglas go through Tholt-y-Will and keep going until you pass a house on the left, there should be a cattle grid around there, the entrance to the field is just after that. Please pull into the field where there&#8217;ll be plenty of space for parking.<br/><br/>So to recap:<br/><br/>Saturday 22nd August<br/>Sulby valley<br/>12pm - 5pm (at latest)<br/>Old clothes<br/><br/>I think that&#8217;s about it! Again, please give us a shout if can definitely make it as it will help with the numbers. Cheers!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-1951082676353469002?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<p><p>First up thanks to everyone who has been in touch and offered to play a zombie, the more the better!<br/><br/>We now have a date and a location for the filming, the date is next Saturday - Aug 22nd, and the location is a field in Sulby valley. I&#8217;ll post details on how to get there later this week.<br/><br/>Looking at the weather forecast for Saturday it looks like it&#8217;s not going to be a super sunny day or anything, but that doesn&#8217;t really matter. As long as it doesn&#8217;t completely piss down we will go ahead with the filming.<br/><br/>As far as costumes go, please feel free to wear whatever you want, although bear in mind that the fake blood we&#8217;re using could stain so wear old clothes if you can, and even better if you don&#8217;t mind having them ripped, torn up, etc.<br/><br/>We will have a load of fake blood and white face make-up to get everyone looking good but if you have (or know anyone with) anything else that might be useful please bring it along and we&#8217;ll see what we can use.<br/><br/>During the week we&#8217;ll come up with a running order for the day so you&#8217;ll all know what&#8217;s going on, but mostly it&#8217;ll be standing around in a field for a few hours, and maybe some lying down too.<br/><br/>We also have a name for the film - GET DEAD. Cool huh? You can also keep up with all the film news on our Facebook group: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110051477377"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110051477377">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110051477377</a></a>.<br/><br/>I think that&#8217;s everything, if there&#8217;s any more info we&#8217;ll post it up during the week. The important things to take note of are the date - Sat 22nd August - and the location - Sulby valley.<br/><br/>Thanks!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-3130660876352422161?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>

<h2>Calling all zombies!<br />

<p><p>We&#8217;ve got a blog!<br/><br/>As some of you may already know a crack team has been assembled to take on the mammoth task of making a zombie short film. For those that don&#8217;t, here&#8217;s the low-down.<br/><br/>So far in the team we&#8217;ve got Sam, Alex, Matty, Alan, Flood, Kim Savini and a handful of other movie-makers and actors and we&#8217;re entering the <a href="http://www.2dayslater.co.uk">www.2dayslater.co.uk</a> 48hrs film-making competition. The aim is to come up with a concept, write a script, cinamise and edit the film over 48 hours (in total, not all in one go) into a 10 minute short, which will then (hopefully!) be shown at premiere of all the films made at Halloween. Check the website out for more details on the competition, but that&#8217;s the gist.<br/><br/>The genre must be horror so we have taken the well-trodden path of the zombie fest film and hope to do it justice. We will be keeping this blog updated as we progress over the following weeks/months to completion, and are going to try and get some behind the scenes footage and stills so you can all be as psyched as we are on making it!<br/><br/>Now here comes the IMPORTANT BIT:<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">We are looking for zombies!</span> All you need to do is turn up in some old clothes you don&#8217;t mind getting wrecked and we&#8217;ll sort the rest.<br/><br/>The exact dates we are shooting haven&#8217;t been decided yet but it will be some time in the next 4 weeks. As soon as we know you&#8217;ll know. We have Kim who&#8217;s doing SFX at uni taking care of the gore etc but if anyone has any experience with stage make-up and the like could lend a hand that would be great too.<br/><br/>We have a Facebook page here: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110051477377"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110051477377">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110051477377</a></a> head over to it, sign up and get involved.<br/><br/>Although we don&#8217;t have any dates confirmed yet we can say it will be over a weekend to get as many people as possible together.<br/><br/>Stay tuned!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6500448833214311783-5210660087962502753?l=sectionfiverecords.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
